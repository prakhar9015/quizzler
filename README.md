Let's play some quiz. This program gets API data from `open trivia database` and the questions can be <br/>
changed to variety of topics.

li>
<li> These game is entirely built using OOP, which makes it more modular and efficient</li>
<li> The `✅` and `❌` button makes the game more fascinating. </li>
